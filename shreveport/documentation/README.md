# Documentation Overview

This directory contains documentation for the freight and logistics management system, organized into logical categories to improve navigation and usability. The documents are written in markdown and stored in a hierarchical structure to support both business and technical users.

## Directory Structure

- **[Freight-Management](./Freight-Management/)**: Documents related to freight operations, including billing, cost calculations, auditing, carrier management, and transportation modes.
- **[Client-Management](./Client-Management/)**: Documentation for client-specific configurations and reporting.
- **[Data-and-Integration](./Data-and-Integration/)**: Details on data management, external integrations, and database platforms.
- **[System-and-Utilities](./System-and-Utilities/)**: Information on system-level tools, automation, logging, user interfaces, and access controls.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with a detailed description of its contents and links to subdirectories or documents. Use these READMEs to navigate the documentation efficiently.

## Getting Started

- Browse the directories based on your role or task (e.g., business analysts may focus on `Freight-Management` and `Client-Management`, while developers may prioritize `Data-and-Integration` and `System-and-Utilities`).
- Use GitHub’s search or a local markdown viewer to find specific topics.
- If a document appears in multiple contexts (e.g., business vs. technical), check the relevant directory’s README for clarification.
