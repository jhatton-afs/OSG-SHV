The international freight billing workflow in AFS Shreveport follows a structured process designed to handle the complexities of cross-border shipments. The process begins with shipment creation, where basic origin and destination information is captured. The system then facilitates the assignment of appropriate international charge codes, with code '1' automatically assigned as the primary freight charge. Based on the nature of the charges, the system routes the entry through different paths - primary freight charges, customs/duties, or miscellaneous charges (which require additional documentation). 

After charge code assignment and amount entry, the system performs automatic calculations to ensure that all charges are properly accounted for and that the total matches the actual charges. If discrepancies are found, the system prompts for recalculation. Once validated, the bill undergoes currency exchange processing if necessary, followed by customs documentation association. The workflow concludes with final validation and bill finalization, ensuring all international requirements have been met before the freight bill is processed for payment.

## Charge Code Structure and Management

International charge codes in the AFS Shreveport system follow a specialized structure designed to accommodate the unique requirements of cross-border shipping. The primary freight charge is designated by code '1', which was adapted from the domestic freight billing system but tailored for international use. Beyond the primary code, the system supports a comprehensive set of specialized codes for duties, taxes, customs fees, brokerage charges, and other international-specific expenses. Each charge code is linked to a description that clearly identifies its purpose, ensuring clarity in billing documentation.

The system enforces strict validation rules for these codes, requiring that they exist in the predefined INTL.CODES table before they can be applied to a freight bill. For miscellaneous charges (MISC code), the system mandates additional documentation in the form of a reason code, ensuring transparency and auditability. The charge code structure also supports hierarchical relationships, with primary freight charges serving as the foundation and additional charges building upon this base. This structured approach ensures that all international charges are properly categorized, validated, and documented, facilitating accurate billing and reporting for global shipments.

The International Billing Data Flow diagram illustrates how information moves through the AFS Shreveport system during international freight billing processes. The flow begins with data inputs from three primary sources: client systems providing shipment details, carrier systems supplying freight charges, and customs databases delivering duty and tax information.

Once this data enters the AFS Shreveport system, it's routed to the International Billing Module, which serves as the central processing hub. This module interacts with several key components: the INTL.CODES table for charge code validation, the Exchange Rate Engine for currency conversion, the Customs Documentation system for regulatory compliance, and the Billing Engine for charge calculation and validation.

The Billing Engine processes all this information to produce three main outputs: validated bills sent to financial systems for payment processing, compliance data directed to regulatory reporting for customs authorities, and detailed billing information provided to client reporting systems for cost analysis.

The diagram shows how data flows not only within the AFS Shreveport system but also extends to external systems, including banking systems for payment processing, customs authorities for compliance reporting, and client analytics platforms for cost analysis. This comprehensive data flow ensures that all aspects of international freight billing—from charge validation to customs compliance to financial reconciliation—are handled efficiently and accurately within a single integrated system.

## Validation Rules and Error Handling

The AFS Shreveport system implements a comprehensive set of validation rules specifically designed for international freight bills, ensuring accuracy and compliance throughout the billing process. These rules begin with basic validations such as ensuring that all charge codes exist in the INTL.CODES table and that required fields contain appropriate values. For international shipments, additional validations include verifying that country codes are valid, customs documentation is complete, and currency information is properly specified.

The system enforces business rules specific to international billing, such as requiring reason codes for miscellaneous charges and ensuring that the total of all line items matches the actual charges. This validation is particularly critical for international shipments, where discrepancies can lead to customs delays or compliance issues. The system also validates currency-related information, ensuring that exchange rates are within acceptable ranges and that converted amounts are calculated correctly.

Error handling in the international freight billing module follows a structured approach. When validation failures occur, the system provides specific error messages that clearly identify the issue and suggest corrective actions. For critical errors that prevent bill processing, the system blocks progression until the issues are resolved. Less critical issues may generate warnings that allow processing to continue but flag the bill for review.

The system maintains a comprehensive audit trail of all validation failures and corrections, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the process. This approach to validation and error handling helps prevent costly mistakes in international billing, reduces customs delays, and ensures compliance with both system requirements and international regulations.
