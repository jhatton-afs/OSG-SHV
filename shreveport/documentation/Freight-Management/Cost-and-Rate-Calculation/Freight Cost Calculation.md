# Freight Cost Calculation in AFS Shreveport

## Currency Conversion in Freight Calculations

Currency conversion plays a critical role in the AFS Shreveport system, particularly for cross-border freight operations between the United States and Canada. The system maintains a centralized conversion rate in the FB.TABLES file under the 'CAN.TO.US.DOLLARS' record, which serves as the foundation for all currency-related calculations.

When processing cross-border shipments, the system applies this conversion rate to transform Canadian dollar amounts to US dollars or vice versa, depending on the billing requirements. This conversion affects multiple aspects of freight calculations, including base rates, accessorial charges, and fuel surcharges. The system enforces logical validation boundaries (between 1.0 and 2.0) for the conversion rate to prevent erroneous calculations that could significantly impact financial reporting.

For financial reporting purposes, the system maintains both the original currency amount and the converted amount, allowing for transparent audit trails and reconciliation. This dual-currency tracking is essential for accurate financial statements, tax compliance, and client billing. The conversion rate's application is consistent across all modules that handle cross-border transactions, ensuring system-wide integrity in financial calculations.

## Cost Calculation Components

The AFS Shreveport system breaks down freight cost calculations into several distinct components that work together to determine the final billable amount:

1. **Base Rates**: The foundational component derived from carrier tariffs or negotiated contracts, typically based on weight breaks, distance zones, or flat rates depending on the shipment type.

2. **Accessorial Charges**: Additional services beyond standard transportation, such as liftgate service, inside delivery, residential delivery, or limited access locations. These are applied as either fixed amounts or percentages of the base rate.

3. **Fuel Surcharges**: Dynamic adjustments that reflect fluctuating fuel costs, calculated as a percentage of the base rate according to carrier-specific or industry-standard fuel indices.

4. **Mileage-Based Calculations**: For distance-dependent pricing models, the system leverages its mileage database to determine precise distances between origin and destination points.

5. **Weight-Based Adjustments**: Including dimensional weight calculations, minimum charges, and excess weight fees that may override standard rates.

6. **Currency Adjustments**: For international shipments, particularly between the US and Canada, the system applies the stored conversion rate to normalize costs to the client's preferred currency.

7. **Taxes and Duties**: For cross-border shipments, the system calculates applicable customs duties, goods and services tax (GST), harmonized sales tax (HST), and other regulatory fees.

8. **Discount Structures**: Client-specific or volume-based discounts that may be applied to the base rate or total charges.

The system maintains these components separately in the calculation process, allowing for detailed audit trails, variance analysis, and the ability to recalculate specific components when rates or factors change.

4. **Audit Logging**: All rate modifications are logged with user information, timestamp, and before/after values, creating a comprehensive audit trail for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

5. **Batch Updates**: For large-scale rate changes, such as general rate increases (GRIs), the system supports batch processing to efficiently update multiple rate entries simultaneously.

6. **Rate Versioning**: Historical rates are preserved, enabling the system to recalculate older shipments using the rates that were in effect at the time of shipment.

7. **Rate Testing**: Before implementing new rates, administrators can test the impact on sample shipments to verify calculations and assess financial implications.

The system's rate management capabilities ensure that freight cost calculations remain accurate and up-to-date, even as market conditions, carrier rates, and currency exchange rates fluctuate.

## Cross-Border Shipping Considerations

Cross-border shipping, particularly between the United States and Canada, introduces several complex cost calculation challenges that the AFS Shreveport system addresses through specialized functionality:

1. **Currency Conversion**: The system maintains a centralized conversion rate between Canadian and US dollars, which is applied consistently across all cross-border transactions. This rate is carefully managed through dedicated utilities like FB.20.4, which includes validation to ensure the rate remains within logical boundaries.

2. **Customs Duties and Brokerage**: For cross-border shipments, the system calculates applicable customs duties based on commodity codes, country of origin, and trade agreements. Brokerage fees are also factored into the total cost calculation.

3. **Tax Calculations**: The system handles complex tax scenarios including Canadian GST/HST, provincial sales taxes, and US state/local taxes. These calculations consider the shipment's origin, destination, and the tax status of both the shipper and consignee.

4. **International Accessorial Charges**: Cross-border shipments often incur additional accessorial charges such as customs clearance fees, documentation preparation, in-bond transit fees, and border crossing charges. The system maintains separate accessorial tables for international shipments.

5. **Documentation Requirements**: The system generates appropriate documentation for cross-border shipments, including commercial invoices, certificates of origin, and customs declarations, all of which may impact the final cost calculation.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Cost calculations for cross-border shipments must account for regulatory requirements such as NAFTA/USMCA documentation, security filings, and other compliance-related expenses.

7. **Multi-Currency Reporting**: The system supports reporting in both origin and destination currencies, maintaining the original values alongside converted amounts for transparency and audit purposes.

8. **Exchange Rate Fluctuations**: For long-term contracts, the system can track exchange rate fluctuations and apply adjustments or surcharges when rates move beyond predetermined thresholds.

```

The currency conversion process in AFS Shreveport is a critical component for handling cross-border freight between the US and Canada. The system maintains the conversion rate in the FB.TABLES file under the 'CAN.TO.US.DOLLARS' record, which administrators can update using the FB.20.4 utility program.

When processing international shipments, the system first retrieves the current conversion rate and validates its existence. If the rate is missing or potentially outdated, the system either applies a default rate or alerts administrators to update it. The FB.20.4 program enforces validation rules to ensure the rate falls within logical boundaries (between 1.0 and 2.0), preventing erroneous calculations.

The direction of conversion depends on the billing requirements and client preferences. For Canadian shipments billed in US dollars, the system multiplies the Canadian amount by the conversion rate. Conversely, for US shipments billed in Canadian dollars, it divides the US amount by the same rate.

Throughout this process, the system maintains both the original and converted amounts for all cost components, ensuring transparency and facilitating audit trails. This dual-currency tracking extends to financial reports, which can be generated in either currency based on user requirements.

The system also includes safeguards against rate fluctuations, with monitoring capabilities to alert administrators when significant changes occur that might impact freight costs. This comprehensive approach ensures accurate and consistent currency conversion across all cross-border freight operations.
